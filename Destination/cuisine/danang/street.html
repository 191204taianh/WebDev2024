        <div class="review-title">A Crawl of Da Nang's Amazing Street Food</div>
        <div class="review-body" style="font-weight: bold;">
            Da Nang, perhaps best known by travelers for its beach resorts, is Vietnam's fifth largest city, and its feet stand in two worlds. Look up and your eyes fill with views of glistening skyscrapers, their sides adorned with garish neon. But the streets are full of flimsy aluminum tables and cheap plastic chairs, seating for the family-owned shops and restaurants that line the sidewalks.

            It's these back streets in central Da Nang that I wander with Summer Le one sticky night in July. Though the city is a haven for traditional Vietnamese cooking, it's not the easiest place for travelers. Signs are only in Vietnamese and shopkeepers don't go out of their way to make tourists happy. But the steaming noodles, aromatic chicken rice, and crackly banh mi you pass on every corner are too enticing a cipher to ignore. So if you want to eat well—and you will, if you know where to look—you need a guide. That's where Summer comes in.

            A former foreign affairs professional turned food blogger, gastro-tourism guide, and hostel owner, Summer is one of the only names in English language food writing in Da Nang, where she's been covering the local food culture for nearly five years. She and her website, DanangCuisine.com, have been featured in media all over Asia, including Vietnam's largest broadcasting network, VTV, as well as in the New York Times as an ambassador of Central Vietnamese cooking.
            <br></br>In addition to chronicling the best food Da Nang has to offer, Summer conducts street food tours by request. She structures her tours to show off what she considers to be the best and most unique dishes in Da Nang. "I like to show very local, original dishes. Not just the good food, but what's interesting."
            <br></br>"I base my tours around my top 10 favorite dishes in Da Nang," Summer tells me before we begin. "It's easy to pick the best restaurants because everyone here knows where they are." Our tour will take us to shops scattered around the central district, some within walking distance, others a short cab ride away.
