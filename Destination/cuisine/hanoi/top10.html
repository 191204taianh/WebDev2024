        <div class="review-title">10 Hanoi food shops that don’t need a name to be famous</div>
        <div class="review-body" style="font-weight: bold;">
            In Hanoi, many street food stalls thrive without names, signs, or advertising, relying solely on word of mouth, a tradition rooted in the city's history. Despite their anonymity, these stalls often serve exceptional meals, offering a true local experience for hungry visitors.
        </div>
        <div class="review-numbering">1. Beef pho (pho bo) | 34 Au Trieu Street</div>
        <div class ="review-body">
            Netizens call this pho bo stall ‘Tư Lùn’ (short Tư), but the middle-aged owner insists on leaving his shop nameless. The rusty signage has been scraped off and is now a blank canvas, but from 6 to 10 in the morning, regulars cram in to get their morning fix of pho.
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center">

        <div class="review-numbering">2. Beef pho (pho bo) | Hang Trong-Hang Bong intersection</div>
        <div class="review-body">
            If a shop sign is optional, then so are tables at this sidewalk stall on Hang Trong Street. Pho Hang Trong is one of the last stalls that still cling to the decades-old practice that requires eaters to hold their own bowls and sometimes to eat standing up. Feeling uncomfortable? In the past, you even had to bring your own bowl!

        <div class="review-numbering">3. Steamed rice rolls (banh cuon) – Nguyen Che Nghia Street</div>
        <div class="review-body">
            The banh cuon shop on Nguyen Che Nghia Street has a sign, but it belongs to another noodle shop. Yes, the two shops share the same location but open as different, a common practice around Hanoi due to the lack of space. Mrs.Tuyet only arrives on her motorbike with a basket of banh cuon, a few bowls and chopsticks at around 3 p.m, but she sells out within the hour.
        </div>

        <div class="review-numbering">4. Snails – 2 Hang Than Street</div>
        <div class="review-body">
            If you're considering tucking into a stack of fresh snails on the sidewalk, there’s no need to go looking for a sign. This small stall serves the best snails braised in garlic, chili and lemongrass, which go perfectly with a beer or two in this chilly weather.

        <div class="review-numbering">5. Fish noodles (bun ca) – 5 Trung Yen Alley, Dinh Liet Street</div>
        <div class="review-body">
            It can take a while to figure out how to zigzag your way down the tiny alley in the busy Old Quarter, but the reward is worth it. There’s not only the fish noodles to tempt diners, this stall also serves some of the best fish spring rolls to go with them. Need more directions? Look for the biggest ficus tree in the alley.
        </div>

        <div class="review-numbering">6. Snail noodles (bun oc) – 6 Hang Chai Street</div>   
        <div class="review-body">
            The small but busy complex of Hang Chai Street sells everything: fake flowers, fried ragworms, clothes and most importantly, one of the best snail noodles in the capital. A bowl of snail noodles goes best with fresh salad, boiled beef and gio – a special Vietnamese pork sausage.

        <div class="review-numbering">7. Vietnamese fritters – 257 La Thanh Street</div>   
        <div class="review-body">
            La Thanh is not the ideal street for sidewalk cuisine due to the lack of space, but some Hanoians still manage to make a living literally on the street. It’d be easy to miss this stall as it blends in with the busy steel shops, but its banana, corn and potato fritters are definitely worth a stop.

        <div class="review-numbering">8. Bun cha – 1 Hang Manh Hang Gai</div>   
        <div class="review-body">
            This restaurant is one of the must try’s here in Hanoi. Given its popularity, it’s true that their food here is very good. A must try dish and resto in Hanoi.

        <div class="review-numbering">9. Deep fried cake balls (banh ran man) – Alley 242, Lac Long Quan Street</div>   
        <div class="review-body">
            If you ever feel hungry in the afternoon, join high school students for this Hanoi snack right in front of a temple in the West Lake area. Deep fried cake balls stuffed with chopped pork might seem too greasy, but the spicy papaya salad that comes with them is a game changer.

        <div class="review-numbering">10. Sticky rice with mung beans (xoi xeo) – 37 Hang Bai</div>   
        <div class="review-body">
            For a bag of fine sticky rice coated with mung bean paste and fried shallots neatly packed in fresh banana leaves, you’ll have to queue from 6-7 a.m. Hang Bai Street offers quite a spacious alley, hence the longer queue for anyone addicted to this savory breakfast.
