        <div class="review-body" style="font-weight: bold;">
            Nha Trang has an impressive culinary scene, rivaling its own reputation as a beachy party city. Being famous for its marine treasures, of course, Nha Trang’s seafood is legendary, but the resort town has more to offer foodies than crab legs and coastlines.

        <div class="review-numbering">1. White sardine fish salad - A signature of Nha Trang cuisine.</div>
        <div class ="review-body">
            This is a popular Nha Trang dish that is served in many restaurants. The principal ingredient of this dish is white sardine freshly caught from the sea. Tamarind, lime, or sour star fruit will be used to extract the fish bone and remove the fishy odor. After being turned ivory-white or gray, the fish meat will be mixed with “thính” (very thin sliced pork skin with smashed peanut), sliced onion, and ginger, herbs.

        <div class="review-numbering">2. Grilled fish cake noodles - The most popular Nha Trang food</div>
        <div class="review-body">
            If Hanoi is known for Pho and Hue is known for Bun Bo Hue, then Nha Trang is known throughout the country for its grilled fish cake noodles.

            <br></br>Fresh mackerel is used to make grilled fish. As a result, each piece of grilled fish is extremely chewy, juicy, and fragrant. You cannot resist a bowl of vermicelli topped with a tasty chewy fish cake, fresh herbs, and dipping sauce. With just a bowl of fish noodles, you can already feel the breath of the Nha Trang sea. Remember to eat the noodles with fresh peppers and herbs to taste the deliciousness of the dish.

        <div class="review-body">
            Squid pancakes in Nha Trang are like pancakes in Saigon but smaller and crisper. These pancakes include fresh squid and shrimp beside the commonly required ingredients.
