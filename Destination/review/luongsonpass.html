            The trial of new trains shuttling between Ho Chi Minh City and Nha Trang beach city, two of Vietnam's most renowned tourist destinations, began on Friday.
        </div>

            The trains, SNT6 and SNT3, are operated by Vietnam Railways Corporation and China's Jinxin Group, with one trip every two days. The trial run will last to Oct. 7, according to the Vietnam Railways Corporation's Saigon Railway Joint Stock Company.

            Departing from the Saigon Railway Station in HCMC at 10:15 p.m., SNT6 arrives in Nha Trang at 8:05 a.m. the following day. SNT3 leaves the Nha Trang Station at 10:20 p.m. and reaches HCMC at 9:15 a.m. They make stops at Di An Station in the southern province of Binh Duong, and Bien Hoa Station in the southern province of Dong Nai.
